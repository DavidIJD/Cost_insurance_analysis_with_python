The provided correlation matrix shows the relationships between various attributes and insurance charges. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key insights:
* Age and Charges (0.299): There is a moderate positive correlation between age and charges, indicating that older individuals tend to have higher insurance costs.
* Gender and Charges (0.063): Gender shows a very weak positive correlation with charges, suggesting minimal impact on insurance costs.
* Body Mass Index (BMI) and Charges (0.200): There is a positive correlation between BMI and charges, indicating that individuals with higher BMI generally incur higher charges.
* Number of Children and Charges (0.066): The number of children has a very weak positive correlation with charges, suggesting a minimal effect on insurance costs.
* Smoker and Charges (0.789): There is a strong positive correlation between smoking status and charges, indicating that smokers typically face significantly higher insurance costs compared to non-smokers.
* Region and Charges (0.054): The region shows a very weak positive correlation with charges, suggesting that geographic location has a minor impact on insurance costs.
Summary: The strongest predictor of insurance charges in this dataset is whether the individual is a smoker, followed by age and BMI. Gender, number of children, and region have minimal impact on insurance charges.
Feature Importance:
* Smoking Status: This attribute has a strong correlation with insurance charges. Models that include smoking status are more effective at predicting charges.
* Additional Features: Including other features like age, BMI, and number of children improves prediction accuracy, highlighting their importance in determining insurance costs.
Model Performance:
* Basic Model: A simple model using only one feature (smoker) explained about 62.2% of the variance in charges.
* Extended Feature Set: Using all available features improved the model, explaining about 75.0% of the variance.
* Polynomial Features: Adding polynomial transformations further enhanced the model, explaining about 84.5% of the variance. This suggests that complex relationships between features significantly impact prediction accuracy.
* Ridge Regression: Regularization with Ridge regression provided a more generalizable model, though with slightly lower performance (67.6%) compared to the polynomial model. The polynomial Ridge model achieved 78.4%, showing that polynomial features combined with regularization help capture more complexity without overfitting.
Practical Implications:
* Enhanced Pricing Accuracy: Improved models lead to more accurate pricing of insurance policies, benefiting both the company and its customers by providing fairer rates based on a comprehensive set of features.
* Risk Assessment: Better predictive models help in assessing risk more effectively, leading to more informed underwriting decisions.
* Competitive Advantage: Advanced modeling techniques such as polynomial regression and Ridge regression can offer a competitive edge by refining the accuracy of predictions and potentially optimizing pricing strategies.
